# Challenge 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit

This challenge is to have drum sounds play when a key on the homerow is pressed. The UI shows each of the homerow keys and their corresponding sounds. When the key is pressed, a subtle animation where the key scales by 10% and the border changes to yellow for 0.7 seconds.

Here is the mapping of the keys to sound:

```
A - Clap
S - HiHat
D - Kick
F - OpenHat
G - Boom
H - Ride
J - Snare
K - Tom
L - Tink
```
