# Challenge 2 - CSS + JS Clock

This challenge is to create a clock with hour, minute and second hands styled using CSS and updated via the time retrieved using JavaScript. The clock hands are to be rotated using CSS transforms and transitioned smoothly at each clock tick. The JavaScript calls a function every second (clock tick) using the setInterval function which will set the styles for each of the hands with the proper rotation.
