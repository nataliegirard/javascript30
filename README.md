# JavaScript30
Following along with the [JavaScript 30 Challenge](https://javascript30.com), this repo contains my versions and additions to the challenges. Each challenge has a development branch that includes the commit history as I worked on the problem. The final solution can be found in the master branch in the appropriate folder along with documentation explaining the problem, my design decisions and my own additions to the exercise. 


I have decided to complete this challenge not because I need to learn JavaScript, but rather because I am bored and some of these exercises look fun to write, especially the whack-a-mole game which I will keep as a reward for getting through the rest of the challenges. Itâ€™s always good for experienced developers to go back to the roots of the programming language and have fun coding different applications.
